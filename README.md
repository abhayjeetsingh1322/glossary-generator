# Glossary Generator

## Description
The **Glossary Generator** is a Java application that creates a collection of HTML files representing a glossary. The program reads an input file containing terms and their definitions and generates:
1. An **index.html** page listing all the terms in alphabetical order, with each term linked to its definition page.
2. Separate HTML pages for each term, including its definition and cross-links to other terms mentioned in the definitions.

This project demonstrates proficiency in **file handling**, **HTML generation**, and **component-based programming**.

## Objectives
1. Design and implement a complete program for glossary generation.
2. Use Javaâ€™s `components` package and standard libraries effectively.
3. Ensure high-quality software development practices, including:
   - Code readability and maintainability.
   - Adherence to coding standards.
   - Modular design.
